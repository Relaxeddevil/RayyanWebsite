                <h2 class="title">Amazon Web-Scraper</h2>
                <p>Created a software which scrapes the prices of given products sold on Amazon.ca and creates a
                    data-frame, returns a boxplot analysis of the prices along with the raw data. I used the selenium
                    library in order to do the webscraping, the pandas library to organize the data into a structured
                    data-frame, and the matplotlib library to display a boxplot. All the code for this project can be
                    viewed on my <a href="https://github.com/Relaxeddevil/AmazonWebScraper">Github</a>

                <h2 class="title">Google Maps API</h2>
                <p>Created a program which when given inputs of a keyword along with a location and radius, returns all
                    business matching the keyword in the given radius with their contact information. This project uses
                    the requests library in order to access the Google API and the xlsxwriter library in order to export
                    the data as a .csv file.</br> All the code for this project can be viewed on my

                <h2 class="title">This Website</h2>
                <p> This website uses the python flask framework in order to handle all of the back-end. The website
                is built using HTML, CSS and javascript. This project helped me to understand how to integrate a back-end system to front-end.

                <h2 class="title">Text Encryption / Decryption</h2>
                <p>Developed the back-end for a text encryption software. The back-end consists of reading a .txt file,
                    encrypting it by shuffling the characters using a randomized algorithm and provides a key that can
                    be used in order to decrypt the file. <br> All the code for this website can be viewed on my

                <p>Developed a script which can recognize a specific image on the screen and click its location.

                    to the correct location using pixel colour detection and clicks.<br> All the code for this script
